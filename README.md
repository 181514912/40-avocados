# 40 Avocados

Apple recently announced the return of their Apple (colorful!) logo from the 
days of old school. And it's only available for $40.00 "exclusively at the Flag Park Visitor's Center,"
as announced on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2018/10/30/apple-introduces-what-weve-all-been-waiting-for/).

Wait, did I hear that right? $40.00 for a T-Shirt? Are you *mad* ?

You know what I'd rather use $40.00 for? Just about anything else. Especially 
something I can eat. Like [40 avocados](https://vsoch.github.io/40-avocados).


What other 40 things could you get, instead of a T-shirt? [Open a pull request](https://www.github.com/vsoch/40-avocados)
to add an image to the list by just adding an entry to the [things.yml](things.yml) file.
